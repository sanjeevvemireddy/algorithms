# algorithms

Created couple of examples for algorithms for sorting and tree traversal. Algorithms are working solutions and can be executed in commandline or IDE. 

Requirements
-----------------
1. Height of BST - This algorithm is to find the height of Binary Search Tree.
2. Level Order Traversal of binary tree  
3. Prime Number - to check if given number is prime number or not.
4. Bubble Sort - 

Technology
